# Obelisk

Work-in-progress ( *really* work-in-progress...RWIP? ) game engine designed for easy-scripting on top of a Rust core for graphics, audio, input and other lower-level systems. Built on an ECS ( probably [shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard) but subject to change ). Initially it will be hardcoded for Python scripting, but we would want to support other languages later.

Comming...maybe never, but hopefully one day! :smiley:
